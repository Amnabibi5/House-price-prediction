## 📖 About the Project

This project is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts house prices based on user input and provides interactive data insights through a dashboard.

Users can:
- Enter property details (area, bedrooms, bathrooms)
- Choose from multiple ML models to predict house prices
- View model performance metrics (R², MSE, F1 Score)
- Explore a dashboard with charts, filters, and feature analysis

The dashboard includes:
- 📊 Summary statistics and price distribution
- 📐 Area vs Price scatter plot
- 🛏 Bedrooms vs Price bar chart
- 🔍 Filters for price range and bedroom count
- 🌡️ Correlation heatmap of numeric features
- 🌲 Feature importance visualization (Random Forest)

This project demonstrates Amna’s ability to:
- Build and deploy ML models with Streamlit
- Create user-friendly interfaces and dashboards
- Organize code and assets ethically and clearly
- Troubleshoot deployment issues and present polished work
